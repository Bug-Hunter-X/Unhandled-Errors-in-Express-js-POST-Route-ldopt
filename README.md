# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Route

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling within request processing routes.  The `POST /user` route is vulnerable because it doesn't check for potential errors, such as a malformed request body or database errors (if interacting with a database).

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a `POST /user` route that simply logs the request body and sends a success response.  It lacks any error handling.  If the client sends invalid JSON, or if any other exception occurs during processing, the server will log the error to the console, but the client will not receive any feedback, potentially leading to confusion and unexpected behavior.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to improve the route by using a `try...catch` block and sending appropriate error responses. This provides better feedback to the client and prevents unexpected crashes.
